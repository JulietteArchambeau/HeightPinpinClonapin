  abstract = {{$<$}h3{$>$}Abstract{$<$}/h3{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}Results from a decade of association studies in different organisms suggest that most complex traits are polygenic, that is, their genetic architectures are determined by numerous causal loci distributed across the genome each with small effect-size. Thus, determining the degree of polygenicity is a central goal to understand the genetic basis of phenotypic variation. Recently, multi-loci methods able to detect variants associated with a phenotype of interest despite the subtle allele frequency changes between populations usually observed have been developed. In this study, we applied two multi-loci methods to estimate the degree of polygenicity of fitness-related traits in a long-lived plant species (maritime pine) and to analyze how polygenicity changes across years and environments. For this purpose, we evaluated five categories of fitness related traits, such as, height, survival, phenology-related, biotic-stress resistance and functional traits in a clonal common garden network planted in contrasted environments. Most of the analyzed traits showed evidences of local adaptation. We observed a remarkably stable degree of polygenicity (average 6\%) across traits, environments and years. Additionally, some of the measured traits showed evidences of negative selection that could explain the observed degree of polygenicity, as previously suggested in humans. The observed genetic architecture of fitness-related traits in maritime pine is in accordance with the polygenic adaptation model. Because polygenic adaptation can take place rapidly, our results can contribute to improve the predictions about the capacity of natural populations of forest trees to adapt to new environments, which is of special relevance in the current context of climate change.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {BackgroundThe animal model is a key tool in quantitative genetics and has been used extensively to estimate fundamental parameters, such as additive genetic variance or heritability. An implicit assumption of animal models is that all founder individuals derive from a single population. This assumption is commonly violated, for instance in crossbred livestock or when a meta-population is split into genetically differentiated subpopulations. Ignoring that base populations are genetically heterogeneous and thus split into different `genetic groups' may lead to biased parameter estimates, especially for additive genetic variance. To avoid such biases, genetic group animal models, which account for the presence of more than one genetic group, have been proposed. Unfortunately, the method to date is only computationally feasible when the breeding values of the groups are allowed to differ in their means, but not in their variances.ResultsWe present an extension of the animal model that permits estimation of group-specific additive genetic variances. This is achieved by employing group-specific relatedness matrices for the breeding value components to different genetic groups. We derive these matrices by decomposing the full relatedness matrix via the generalized Cholesky decomposition, and by scaling the respective matrix components for each group. We propose a computationally convenient approximation for the matrix component that encodes for the Mendelian sampling variance, and show that this approximation is not critical. In addition, we explain why segregation variances are often negligible when analyzing the complex polygenic traits that are frequently the focus of evolutionary ecologists and animal breeders. Simulations and an example from an insular meta-population of house sparrows in Norway with three distinct genetic groups illustrate that the method is successful in estimating group-specific additive genetic variances, and that segregation variances are indeed negligible in the empirical example.ConclusionsQuantifying differences in additive genetic variance within and among populations is of major biological interest in ecology, evolution, and animal and plant breeding. The proposed method allows to estimate such differences for subpopulations that form a connected set of populations, and may thus also be useful to study temporal or spatial variation of additive genetic variances.},

  abstract = {Understanding adaptive genetic responses to climate change is a main challenge for preserving biological diversity. Successful predictive models for climate-driven range shifts of species depend on the integration of information on adaptation, including that derived from genomic studies. Long-lived forest trees can experience substantial environmental change across generations, which results in a much more prominent adaptation lag than in annual species. Here, we show that candidate-gene SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) can be used as predictors of maladaptation to climate in maritime pine (Pinus pinaster Aiton), an outcrossing long-lived keystone tree. A set of 18 SNPs potentially associated with climate, 5 of them involving amino acid-changing variants, were retained after performing logistic regression, latent factor mixed models, and Bayesian analyses of SNP\textendash{}climate correlations. These relationships identified temperature as an important adaptive driver in maritime pine and highlighted that selective forces are operating differentially in geographically discrete gene pools. The frequency of the locally advantageous alleles at these selected loci was strongly correlated with survival in a common garden under extreme (hot and dry) climate conditions, which suggests that candidate-gene SNPs can be used to forecast the likely destiny of natural forest ecosystems under climate change scenarios. Differential levels of forest decline are anticipated for distinct maritime pine gene pools. Geographically defined molecular proxies for climate adaptation will thus critically enhance the predictive power of range-shift models and help establish mitigation measures for long-lived keystone forest trees in the face of impending climate change.},
